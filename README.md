# NgrxBlog

This is a prototype of a Blog Application built with Angular 18, Angular Material 18, and NgRx 18 for state management. The app allows users to view blog posts, as well as create, edit, and delete their own blogs once they are logged in.

## Tech Stack

- **Angular 18**: Framework used to build the UI.
- **NgRx 18**: For managing state across the application.
- **Angular Material 18**: Provides UI components like dialogs, buttons, and forms.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed language for better development experience.
- **RxJS**: Reactive programming using observables for asynchronous operations.
- **NgRx Store LocalStorage**: Used to persist state such as authentication and blogs across browser reloads.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
